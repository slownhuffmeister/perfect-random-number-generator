#Perfect Random Number Generator 1.0.2
perfection created by Slown Huffmeister

##About
While I HATE version control, due to a very important question asked on my tumblr, "
GIRL CAN I HAVE YO NUMBA?", I have decided that a random number generator needs 
to be created to give this person my "NUMBA". And, excuse me but random.org is 
not random enough for me.  Don't worry, I, the perfect and great Slown, will 
create the best random number generator.  


##Install 
	gem install perfect-random-number-generator


##Usage

	require 'perfect-random-number-generator'

To generate a random number

	PerfectRandom::rand
